<summary><strong>1) Vocabulary</strong></summary>

- **component guideline** /kəmˈpoʊnənt ˈɡaɪdˌlaɪn/ (n) - short guide explaining when and how to use a UI component
  _Example 1:_ The component guideline explained button variants, disabled states, and usage rules.
  _Example 2:_ Designers and engineers used the guideline to avoid one-off UI decisions.
  _Example 3:_ A good guideline prevents repeated questions.

- **UI state spec** /ˌjuːˈaɪ steɪt spɛk/ (n) - clear list of loading, empty, success, error, and permission states
  _Example 1:_ QA used the UI state spec to test edge cases.
  _Example 2:_ Missing error-state specs caused rework during checkout testing.
  _Example 3:_ UI state docs are often more useful than long implementation notes.

- **Storybook page** /ˈstɔːriˌbʊk peɪdʒ/ (n) - visual page showing component variants and examples
  _Example 1:_ The Storybook page showed default, loading, disabled, and error variants.
  _Example 2:_ New engineers used Storybook to understand component behavior quickly.
  _Example 3:_ Storybook is useful when it stays updated with real product usage.

- **wireframe note** /ˈwaɪərˌfreɪm noʊt/ (n) - clarification attached to a design or wireframe
  _Example 1:_ I added wireframe notes for mobile error behavior.
  _Example 2:_ One missing wireframe note created a scope debate.
  _Example 3:_ Good notes explain unclear behavior before implementation starts.

- **API example** /ˌeɪ piː ˈaɪ ɪɡˈzæmpəl/ (n) - sample request, response, or error used to clarify backend behavior
  _Example 1:_ We included API examples for success, validation error, and permission error.
  _Example 2:_ Clear API examples reduced frontend integration questions.
  _Example 3:_ API examples are easier to use than abstract descriptions.

- **handoff note** /ˈhændˌɔːf noʊt/ (n) - short doc that transfers context to QA, support, or another engineer
  _Example 1:_ The handoff note included screenshots, expected states, and known issues.
  _Example 2:_ Support used the note to answer users after launch.
  _Example 3:_ Handoff notes are valuable when they are short and specific.

- **release checklist** /rɪˈliːs ˈtʃɛkˌlɪst/ (n) - list of checks before launching a feature
  _Example 1:_ Our release checklist includes smoke tests, analytics, feature flags, and rollback steps.
  _Example 2:_ The checklist caught one missing error state before release.
  _Example 3:_ A checklist protects the team when launch pressure is high.

- **doc ownership** /dɑːk ˈoʊnərˌʃɪp/ (n) - clear responsibility for keeping documentation accurate
  _Example 1:_ We assigned doc ownership by feature area.
  _Example 2:_ Without ownership, examples became outdated.
  _Example 3:_ The owner is not the only writer; the owner keeps the doc reliable.

- **troubleshooting note** /ˈtrʌbəlˌʃuːtɪŋ noʊt/ (n) - short fix-oriented note for common issues
  _Example 1:_ We created troubleshooting notes for login and payment failures.
  _Example 2:_ Support used the notes before escalating to engineers.
  _Example 3:_ Troubleshooting notes reduce repeated questions during incidents.

- **documentation drift** /ˌdɑːkjəmenˈteɪʃən drɪft/ (n) - when docs become different from real product behavior
  _Example 1:_ Documentation drift happened after the component changed but the Storybook page did not.
  _Example 2:_ Drift makes docs less trustworthy.
  _Example 3:_ Regular ownership checks reduce drift.

**Additional useful terms:**

- **acceptance criteria** - conditions that define when a task is done
- **known issue** - documented problem not fixed yet
- **example snippet** - short practical code or text sample
- **source of truth** - official place for the latest decision
- **doc bundle** - small set of linked docs for one feature

<summary><strong>2) Grammar & Useful Patterns (B2)</strong></summary>

- **Purpose language**
  We write UI state specs so QA can test edge cases without guessing.

- **Cause and result**
  Because the error behavior was undocumented, QA reopened the ticket near release.

- **Contrast**
  Writing docs takes time, but it saves more time during handoff and testing.

- **Priority**
  We document high-risk behavior first, not every tiny implementation detail.

- **Ownership**
  Frontend owns UI behavior notes, backend owns API examples, and product confirms business rules.

- **Reflection**
  If we had documented the edge cases earlier, the release would have been smoother.

### Useful Sentence Patterns

- This document is for...
- The most useful section is...
- The documentation gap was...
- We reduced confusion by...
- The owner of this doc is...
- The non-negotiable part is...
- The measurable impact was...
- We keep it updated by...

### Strong Collocations

- document UI states
- write component guidelines
- update Storybook examples
- attach wireframe notes
- add API examples
- create handoff notes
- run release checklists
- assign doc ownership
- reduce documentation drift

- The result was fewer...

### Useful Phrasal Verbs

- **write up** -> I wrote up the API examples after integration.
- **fill in** -> We filled in missing error-state details.
- **hand over** -> We handed over behavior notes to QA before release.
- **clean up** -> We cleaned up outdated setup steps.
- **look up** -> New engineers can look up component behavior quickly.

<summary><strong>4) Dialogues</strong></summary>

### Dialogue 1 - Docs As Delivery Tool

**PM:** Why do we need a behavior note for this feature?

**You:**
Because the flow has several edge cases: loading, failed payment, pending payment, and retry behavior. If we do not write them down, QA and support will ask the same questions later.

A short note now can prevent rework during release week.

### Dialogue 2 - Useful Doc Bundle

**QA:** What should I test before sign-off?

**You:**
I prepared a small doc bundle: UI state spec, API examples, known issues, and release checklist. The most important part is payment failure and pending state.

If anything does not match the note, please flag it before we enable the feature flag for more users.

### Dialogue 3 - Keeping Docs Updated

**Engineer:** How do we stop docs from becoming outdated?

**You:**
We need ownership and update triggers. If a component behavior changes, the Storybook page and usage guideline should be updated in the same pull request.

Otherwise the doc becomes less reliable, and people stop using it.

<summary><strong>5) Debate Prompt</strong></summary>

**Should engineers spend meaningful time on documentation, or focus mainly on coding?**

**Side A:** Coding should come first because users need working features, not beautiful documents.

**Side B:** Practical docs are part of delivery because they reduce rework, QA confusion, support pressure, and onboarding time.

_Your turn: Which documents are worth writing even when the deadline is tight?_

<summary><strong>6) Reading Text</strong></summary>

Good documentation is not long. It is clear, practical, and used in real delivery work. A useful doc helps someone make a decision, test a scenario, answer a user, or change a feature safely.

For frontend teams, high-value docs often include UI state specs, component guidelines, Storybook examples, wireframe notes, API examples, and release checklists. These docs reduce repeated questions and prevent late rework.

In 2026, AI can help draft documentation, but it can also create generic or outdated content. Engineers still need to verify examples, remove sensitive data, and keep docs close to real product behavior. The best documentation is not written to look complete. It is written so the team can work with less confusion.

<summary><strong>7) Questions & Practice Ideas</strong></summary>

### Core Questions (must-practice)

1. Which document in your team saves the most time, and why?
2. How do you decide what must be documented before release?
3. What is one example of rework caused by unclear docs?
4. How do you assign documentation ownership in a practical way?

### High-Value Discussion Questions

5. What are the benefits and limits of short docs versus detailed docs?
6. How do documentation habits differ between beginner and experienced engineers?
7. When should teams prioritize docs over feature speed?

### Follow-up Questions (Challenge Assumptions)

8. You said short docs are better. What important context may be lost?
9. You said docs reduce QA issues. What if QA still reports confusion?
10. If deadlines are tight, which docs are non-negotiable?

### Reflection Questions

11. Which documentation phrase is hardest for you to use naturally in English?
12. What one documentation habit will you start this week?
13. In your future role, will documentation quality influence your career growth?

**Tips for speaking practice:**

- Use one real document and one measurable impact.
- Keep flow: confusion -> doc change -> team impact.
- Mention who uses the doc: QA, PM, support, design, backend, or future engineers.
- Avoid saying "write more docs"; say what specific doc solves what problem.
